Ask: â€œWho will be the crisis manager?"

##### 2. Identify cricothyroid membrane
If anatomy not palpable, consider surgical cricothyroidotomy with blunt
dissection using scalpel-bougie-tube technique ( ALGORITHM 6 )

##### 3. Use Insyte 14G or Ravussin needle catheter connected to 5ml syringe with normal saline

* Stab over midpoint of cricothyroid membrane, at an angle 45-60 degree to the skin, in a caudad direction
* On aspiration of air into 5ml syringe, advance 2mm and confirm aspiration of air again before advancing catheter over needle
